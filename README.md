# RPS-Multiplayer

This is an online multi-player Rock Paper Scissors game powered by Firebase.

The first two users to enter their names become player 1 and player 2. Each player will take turns choosing either rock, paper, or scissors and the score will update after each match.

Spectators are allowed to chat as they watch the two players duke it out.

When a player disconnects the scores will reset and a new player will be able to enter the fray.

## Instructions

Enter your name (if there isn't already a match going on!)

When it is your turn, your choices will show up in your box. Make your choice count!

If you beat your opponent you will score a point!

While you are waiting for your turn you can chat with other spectators!
